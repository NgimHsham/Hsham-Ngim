<h4>A simulation developed from scratch using Pygame to simulate the movement of vehicles across a traffic intersection having traffic lights with a timer. Some statistics and analytical features added to the previous version to help in Modelling problems, Data Analysis tasks, and AI applications.</h4>

### Features added:

- `Vehicle counts` - The number of vehicles that have crossed the intersection is displayed adjacent to each traffic signal for each direction.
- `Time Elapsed` - The time elapsed since the start of the simulation is displayed at the top right.
- `Simulation Duration` - The total duration of simulation or end time can be set. The simulation will quit automatically when the time elapsed is equal to the simulation duration.
- `Printing timers on Terminal` - The timer values of all signals are printed on the Terminal every second. This is useful for effective debugging while customizing the simulation according to your application.
- `Printing cumulative statistics` - Statistics like direction-wise vehicle counts, total vehicles, and simulation time are printed on the Terminal at the end of the simulation, as shown in the image below.
